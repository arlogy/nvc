# Examples to get started with ncv

- `fsm_data`: contains sample FSM data files; they can be imported and
downgraded to any other model type supported by nvc; this is because unexpected
properties are ignored during import.
- `html_pages`: contains HTML examples illustrating how to use nvc; these
examples can be run locally (after download or `git clone`).
