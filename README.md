nvc
- stands for *Network View Controller*.
- is a tool to control the rendering process of a given network view (basically
an HTML `<canvas>` element).
- can be configured to draw graphs or finite state machines.
- features import/export in several formats: `in & out` (JSON), `in only`
(none), `out only` (LaTeX, PNG and SVG).
- is MIT-licensed, reusable in other projects but not mobile-friendly.

nvc was created in 2020 and originates from Evan Wallace's
[FSM Designer](https://github.com/evanw/fsm) created back in 2010. His project
is MIT-covered too. The main difference with nvc is that the latter comes with
configurable options and is ready to use in your own projects, including key
changes recorded in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), especially for version 0.9.0.

A short documentation and practical examples are available [here](doc).
