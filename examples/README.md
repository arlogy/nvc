# Examples to get started with ncv

## FSM data

`fsm_data` contains sample FSM data files exported from nvc. These files can be
imported into nvc regardless of the targeted model type, as unexpected
properties are ignored during import.

## HTML pages

`html_pages` contains standalone HTML examples illustrating how to use nvc.
These examples can be run locally (after download or `git clone`). However, be
sure to run `npm run examples:html:update` first to generate latest dependencies
for the examples, assuming `npm install` has already been executed.
